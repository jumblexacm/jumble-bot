## Create the Discord bot

https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro

1. Create the [team](https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/teams)
    - Visit https://discord.com/developers/teams
    - Click **[New Team]**

2. Create the [app](https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro#bots-and-apps)
    - Visit https://discord.com/developers/applications
    - Click **[New application]**
    - Choose your team from earlier (not your personal team)

3. Add the redirect URI
    - Input your app's about page or another URL for the user to see after installing your app

3. Create the bot  
(As far as [@kirmar](https://github.com/kirmar) can tell, the app must have a bot user to join a server / read any messages.)
    - Menu section: **"Bot"**
    - Click **[Add Bot]**
    - Under **"Privileged Gateway Intents"**, check `Message Content Intent`

4. Generate the invite URL
    - Menu section: **"OAuth2"** > **"URL Generator"**
    - Choose [permissions](https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/oauth2#oauth2):
        - Under **"Scopes"**, check `bot`
        - Under **"Bot Permissions"**, check `Read Messages/View Channels`
    - As your redirect URL, choose your redirect URI from earlier
    - Copy the generated URL, because it disappears if you navigate away from the page. This URL lets you add the bot to a server.


## Repo conventions

Branch naming convention
